= Step 6: Configuration
:toc:
:toc-title:

At this stage, our first application is now ready. However, before we run the application, we have
to provide some configuration details like database connection etc.

Open the `src/main/resources/axelor-config.properties` file and set the database
configuration as described bellow.

[source,properties]
.src/main/resources/axelor-config.properties
----
# Database settings
# ~~~~~
db.default.ddl = update
db.default.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/axelor-demo  <1>
db.default.user = user <2>
db.default.password = secret <3>
----
<1> use the database `axelor-demo`
<2> the postgresql user
<3> the postgresql user's password

TIP: You can also provide external config file with `-Daxelor.config=/path/to/dev.properties`

TIP: You can also provide config value with system properties `-Daxelor.config.db.default.password=secret`

Create the database using the postgresql's `createdb` utility:

[source,sh]
----
$ createdb axelor-demo
----

The `axelor-config.properties` has few more settings that you can adjust if you wish.

== What's Next?

In this chapter we seen how to provide application configure. In the
xref:step7.adoc[next chapter] we will see how to run the application and access
the web frontend.
