:toc-title:

The web client is developed using the following web technologies:

. react - modern JavaScript framework
. bootstrap - CSS framework

The {page-component-title} web is the only and official frontend application included with
the {page-component-title}.

The web app is generic enough to cover most needs.
Most of the time, developers only need to work on XML views, actions, and server-side Java code.
