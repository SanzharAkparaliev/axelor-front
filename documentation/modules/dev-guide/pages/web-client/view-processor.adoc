= View Processors

:toc-title:

View processors allow to programmatically add view elements. They are automatically discovered on application startup,
and they are executed in module resolution order, after finding view in `MetaService::findView`, which is used by
`view` API endpoint.

WARNING: You manipulate the view structure at this point. It is important to understand and validate each changes
depending on object manipulated in order to avoid unexpected behavior during the rendering. Use it with caution.

Example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyViewProcessor implements ViewProcessor {

  @Override
  public void process(AbstractView view) {
    // Do something to the `view`.
  }
}
----
