= Custom Models

:toc-title:

Starting from {page-component-title} v5, we can now add custom data models dynamically at runtime. The feature can be used
for use cases like dynamic survey forms, or preparing quick prototype etc.

== Models

The custom models can be defined from menu:Administration[Model Management > Custom Models].

The image bellow shows the grid view listing all the defined custom models:

Custom models are defined as `com.axelor.meta.db.MetaJsonModel` records with following properties:

[%header,cols="2,8"]
|===
| Name        | Description
| `name`      | Name of the custom model
| `title`     | Display name of the custom model
| `onNew`     | Action to call when creating new record
| `onLoad`    | Action to call when loading record of this model
| `metaMenu`  | Menu to use for this model
| `metaForm`  | Form view to use for this model
| `metaGrid`  | Frid view to use for this model
| `roles`     | Roles who have permission to see these models
|===

== Views

When we create custom models, `form` view and `grid` views along with a `menu` are automatically created.

The image bellow shows the grid view for a custom model `Question`.
