The dashboard is used to provide overviews. The dashboard view is composed of
dashlets.

<dashboard name="welcome.dashboard" title="Welcome!">
  <dashlet action="chart:chart.sales.per.month"/>
  <dashlet action="chart:chart.sales.per.month.pie"/>
  <dashlet colSpan="12" action="sale.orders"/>
</dashboard>

Dashlets are nothing but embedded views. The following view types are supported:
`grid`, `chart`, `custom`, `cards`, `kanban`, `calendar`, `tree`, `gantt`, `html`.

The dashlet `action` can be either:

* an `action-view`. The first view of that action-view will be used in dashlet.
* `<view-type>:<view-name>` value where `<view-type>` is one of the supported view types
and `<view-name>`, the name of the view.

The recommended way is to use an `action-view` instead of `<view-type>:<view-name>`. It 
provides more controls and configuration of what is displayed.
