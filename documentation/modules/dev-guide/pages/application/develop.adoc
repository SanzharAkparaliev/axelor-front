In this chapter, we will see how to develop axelor applications effectively.

== Requirements

Please check the xref:getting-started:index.adoc[getting started guide] for
pre-requisites and configuring your favourite IDE.

== Run in Debug mode

You can run the application in debug mode during development like this:

[source,sh]
----
$ ./gradlew --no-daemon run --debug-jvm
----

This will start the app in debug mode waiting for debugger on `5005` port. Attach your
favourite Java debugger on this port to start debugging.

== XML Hotswap

If you run the app in debug mode as mentioned above, changes to XML views
are hot reloaded. However, you still have to refresh current view with browser refresh button.

Moreover, this feature is experimental and has limitations. For example, it can only detect
XML file changes once the application is started. Any changes done before application start
are not recognized. That issue will be resolved in upcoming releases.
