title: Fix m2m field update issue
type: fix
description: |
  The m2m items, upon select/edit should not be fully populated as the record
   is already saved (similar to m2o).
  In controllers, make sure to return a compact map in m2m fields, ie a
  list of map with the records ids. Then, the view will fetch the records
  with all necessary fields by itself.
